- 👋 Hi, I’m @sfkoryagina, a Psych BSc graduate who will be going into a brain imaging PhD project to study the auditory system and hearing using MRI, DTI, and fMRI.
- 👀 I’m interested in statistics, neuroimaging, neurotechnology, bioengineering, and robotics. I also love drawing, fitness, and cooking!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming on CS50 to ensure I am prepared for my PhD project, which will use Python for MRI data analysis. I'm also looking for other short-term training and employment opportunities to develop my analytical skills further!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making music videos and/or producing electronic music in the far, far future; also interested in scientific project collaborations and any experience in data analysis.
